the long and winding road
the night before
the world
there's a place
things we said today
think for yourself
ticket to ride
till there was you
tomorrow never knows
twist and shout
two of us
wait
what goes on
what you're doing
when i get home
when i'm sixty-four
while my guitar gently weeps
why don't we do it in the road
wild honey pie
with a little help from my friends
within you without you
words of love

you can't do that
you like me too much
you never give my your money
you won't see me
you're going to lose that girl
you've got to hide your love away
